This repository serves as a place where we store all of the code used inside the report, for which references are provided appropriately within the report.

The first two files, BuchAlgorithm.pdf and ImprovedBuch.nb, gives a theoretical explanation of the (improved) Buchberger's algorithm, while the second file gives us the way we implemented it into Mathematica.
