# Groebner Bases
This repository serves as a place where we store all of the code used inside the report, for which references are provided appropriately within the report.

The first two files, BuchAlgorithm.pdf and ImprovedBuch.nb, gives a theoretical explanation of the (improved) Buchberger's algorithm, while the second file gives us the way we implemented it into Mathematica.
Then Magic_squares_Notes.nb, largegraph.nb, largesporadic.nb and groeben_Basis_Example_one.nb store the information of the examples used throughout the report.
Then SetConstruction.nb provides us with the code needed to construct the sets that are used inside the report.
Finally Speed_Comparison.nb and vertices_speed.nb is where we tested the speed at which the in-built GroebnerBasis function in Mathematica would compute Groebner bases.
